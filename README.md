# Twitter-Analysis

Welcome to the Twitter-Analysis project! This project is focused on analyzing Twitter data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide to Twitter data analysis, covering everything from data preparation and visualization to sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

This project contains a Jupyter notebook, "Twitter Analysis.ipynb", which serves as the main hub for all the analysis. The notebook is written in Python and uses popular libraries such as Tweepy, TextBlob, and Scikit-Learn. The notebook also includes practical examples and case studies that demonstrate how to apply Twitter data analysis in real-world scenarios.
